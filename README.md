# Debugging #1 
This program was an introduction to debugging and how you solve a problem. the first step I did to solve the solution was to first read the error messages given by the IDE and go from there then tighten to loop by printing out variables throughout the program to figure out what was happening. 

The solution to these two methods was fairly easy to solve and understand after taking a moment to figure out what the program was doing.
